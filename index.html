        <div class="AboutPhotography">
            <p>Photography is the art of <strong>light in the act of telling a story</strong>. Every photograph begins with<br>
                <em>Light traveling through a lens, brushing against a sensor or film, and leaving behind a frozen moment</em>. But<br>
                beyond the technical dance of apertures, shutter speeds, and ISO, photography is about attention. It asks <br>
                photographer to notice the tilt of a shadow, the pause in someone’s expression, the way the world briefly aligns<br>
                before moving on again.<br></p>

            <p>At its core, <span>photography is a language without words. A single image can communicate emotion, culture,<br>
                conflict, or beauty faster than a page of text ever could</span>. A well-composed photograph guides the viewer’s eye like<br>
                a quiet conversation, using framing, contrast, and perspective to emphasize what matters most. Whether it’s<br>
                wildlife in motion, a crowded street, or a solitary object, photography gives meaning to what might otherwise pass<br>
                unnoticed.<br></p>

            <p>Photography also serves as a bridge between memory and reality. It preserves moments that time would<br>
                otherwise erode, allowing people to revisit <strong>places, faces, and feelings</strong> long after they have changed. In this way,<br>
                photography is both documentary and creative expression. It records the world as it is, while<br>
                simultaneously revealing how the photographer sees it, turning ordinary seconds into lasting visual echoes.<br></p>
